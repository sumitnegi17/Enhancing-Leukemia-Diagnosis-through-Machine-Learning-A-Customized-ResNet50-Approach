## Abstract

Leukemia diagnosis, particularly for **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**, is challenging due to its complex classification process. This study introduces a custom **ResNet50** CNN model combined with **Lazy Predict** for automated model selection, achieving a significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency for leukemia classification.

### üß† Key Features:
- **Custom ResNet50**: Tailored for leukemia image analysis, achieving 87% accuracy and 83% balanced accuracy.
- **Lazy Predict Integration**: Automates the evaluation of various classifiers, streamlining the model selection process.
- **Real-time Capable**: Optimized for fast inference, making it ideal for real-time leukemia diagnosis in clinical settings.

## Methodology

### Dataset
Utilized the **C-NMC leukemia dataset** with 10,661 images, focusing on acute lymphoblastic leukemia and normal cell differentiation.

### Workflow:
1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Otsu‚Äôs Thresholding for segmentation.
   - Binary thresholding and black area removal for enhanced feature isolation.
   - Data augmentation to tackle class imbalance.
  
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Modified **ResNet50** with additional custom layers.
   - Lazy Predict used to evaluate multiple classifiers for optimal performance.

###Experimental Results
The customized ResNet50 model demonstrated superior performance over traditional models, achieving high accuracy and balanced accuracy. Key classifiers tested include:

-Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
-XGBoost Classifier (XGBClassifier)
-LightGBM Classifier (LGBMClassifier)

## Results

üöÄ **Accuracy**: 87%  
‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced Accuracy**: 83%  
‚è±Ô∏è **Inference Time**: Fast, making it suitable for real-time applications.
